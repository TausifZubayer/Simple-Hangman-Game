A simple console hangman game written in C++.

The player will try to guess a word. The word will consist of capital letters.

The player will try to guess each character of the word. He will write a capital letter and press enter.

If the character is not present in the hidden word, then a part of the hangman will be drawn on the screen.

But if the character matches, then no part of the hangman will be drawn.

If the player becomes successful in guessing all the characters of the word before the full hangman is drawn, then the player wins.

Otherwise if the full hangman is drawn before guessing all the correct letters, then the player loses.
